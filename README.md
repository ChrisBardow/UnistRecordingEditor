# Uni[st] PC Recording Editor

This program can edit existing recordings for Under Night In-Birth: Exe Late [st] for use in training mode to practice situations that would otherwise be unrecordable.



## Instructions:

1: Start Training Mode.

2: Start the executable, if all goes well a text box should appear with a button and a dropdown below.

3: Enter your inputs in the text box.  The format is as follows:

(numpad direction)(optional combination of A-D),(#of frames to hold the input)

The numpad direction is required, if you want to input no direction, you must use 5.

Example: This will do a frame-perfect 623B, each input only lasting for one frame.  Separate lines are mandatory as shown below.

6,1

2,1

3B,1

4: If you input everything correctly, you should see the "Overwrite Slot" button enabled.  Before that, check how long the inputs you put in are in frames.

Record something in a slot you don't care about that is at least that number of frames long.  It doesn't matter what it is, it just matters how long it is.

5: Pick a slot, hit "Overwrite Slot", and play your recording!  

Happy labbing!
